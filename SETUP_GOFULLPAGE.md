# GoFullPage Extension Setup

The application now uses the **GoFullPage** Chrome extension for professional full-page screenshots.

## üì• How to Get the Extension

### Option 1: Download CRX File (Recommended)

1. **Download GoFullPage CRX file**:
   - Visit: https://chrome-extension-downloader.com/
   - Paste extension URL: `https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gofull-page-full-page-scr/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl`
   - Download the `.crx` file

2. **Place in Project Directory**:
   ```
   portoptimizer_screenshot_api/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gofullpage.crx          ‚Üê Place the file here
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ automation.py
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
   ```

3. **Rename the file**:
   - Make sure it's named exactly: `gofullpage.crx`

### Option 2: Pack Extension Manually

1. **Install GoFullPage in Chrome**:
   - Visit: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gofull-page-full-page-scr/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl
   - Click "Add to Chrome"

2. **Get Extension Files**:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
   - Find "GoFullPage - Full Page Screen Capture"
   - Note the extension ID: `fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl`
   - Click "Pack extension"
   - Browse to extension location (usually in `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl\`)
   - Pack and save as `gofullpage.crx`

3. **Move to Project**:
   - Copy `gofullpage.crx` to project root directory

## ‚úÖ Verify Installation

Run this command to check if the extension file is found:

```bash
python -c "import os; print('‚úì Found' if os.path.exists('gofullpage.crx') else '‚úó Not found')"
```

## üöÄ How It Works

When taking a screenshot:

1. ‚úÖ Extension loads automatically when Chrome starts
2. ‚úÖ After login (45 sec wait), page scrolls to top
3. ‚úÖ **Chrome is FORCED to top and fullscreen TWICE** (before capture) using Windows API
4. ‚úÖ System-level keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + Shift + K** is sent via pynput
5. ‚úÖ Extension captures full scrollable page (15 sec wait)
6. ‚úÖ Script finds the new tab opened by extension
7. ‚úÖ Download button is clicked automatically
8. ‚úÖ **Download permission popup is handled** (clicks "Allow" if appears)
9. ‚úÖ Waits 10 seconds for download to complete
10. ‚úÖ Extension tab is closed
11. ‚úÖ Returns to main window
12. ‚úÖ Screenshot saved to `screenshots/` folder with timestamp

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcut Setup

**IMPORTANT**: The automation uses **Ctrl + Shift + K** to avoid conflicts with browser shortcuts.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Why not Alt+Shift+P?** That shortcut conflicts with browser's "New Tab Group" feature.

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`
2. Find "GoFullPage - Full Page Screen Capture"
3. Click in the shortcut field next to "Capture Entire Page"
4. Press: **Ctrl+Shift+K** (exactly these keys)
5. Make sure it shows "Ctrl+Shift+K" in the field
6. The automation will send: **Ctrl + Shift + K** as system-level keyboard input

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Keyboard Shortcut**: Must set **Ctrl+Shift+K** in `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` (avoids conflicts with browser shortcuts like "New Tab Group")

2. **Dependencies Required**: 
   - `pip install pynput==1.7.6` - for system-level keyboard automation
   - `pip install pywin32==306` - for Windows window management

3. **Automatic Window Management**: Script **automatically** forces Chrome to top and fullscreen before screenshot

4. **System-Level Input**: Uses pynput to send real OS keyboard events (indistinguishable from real keyboard)

5. **Headless Mode**: Does NOT work in headless mode. Chrome must be visible.

6. **File Location**: Place `gofullpage.crx` in the **project root directory** (same level as `app.py`)

7. **Filename**: Must be named exactly `gofullpage.crx` (lowercase)

8. **Downloads**: Screenshots download to `screenshots/` folder automatically

9. **First Run**: Extension may show welcome screen first time - this is handled automatically

10. **Windows Only**: pywin32 window forcing works on Windows. For Linux/Mac, window management may differ.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "WARNING: gofullpage.crx not found"
- Check file is in project root directory
- Check filename is exactly `gofullpage.crx`
- Check file permissions (should be readable)

### Keyboard shortcut not working
- Go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`
- Verify **Alt+Shift+P** is set for GoFullPage
- Make sure shortcut is "Global" or "In Chrome"
- Check no other extension is using the same shortcut
- Install pynput: `pip install pynput==1.7.6`
- Ensure Chrome window is maximized and on top
- Verify Chrome is the active window (not minimized)
- Try manual shortcut (Right Alt + Shift + P) to test

### "No new tab detected"
- Extension may need more time - increase wait from 15 to 20 seconds
- Verify keyboard shortcut is properly configured
- Try manual shortcut (Alt+Shift+P) to test
- Check Chrome has focus when shortcut is pressed

### Download button not found
- Extension may need more time - increase wait from 15 to 20 seconds
- Check if extension tab actually opened
- Verify extension works manually first (Alt+Shift+P)

### Screenshot not captured
- Make sure page is fully loaded (45 second wait should be enough)
- Check if extension has necessary permissions
- Try manual capture first to verify extension works
- Ensure Chrome window is visible (not minimized)

### Download permission popup not handled
- Script tries multiple methods to detect and click "Allow"
- Check console logs to see which method was used
- If popup still blocks, manually allow downloads for the extension once
- Chrome may remember the permission for future runs

## üîÑ Alternative: Use CDP Method

If you can't get the extension, you can revert to the CDP method by uncommenting the CDP code in `automation.py`. The extension method is recommended for better quality.
